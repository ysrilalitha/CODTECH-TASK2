OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

To develop a fraud detection model for credit card transactions, we can use supervised learning with techniques to handle imbalanced data, or anomaly detection, which is well-suited for identifying rare events like fraud. Hereâ€™s a structured approach to creating and evaluating this model:

1. Project Objective
To build a fraud detection system that can accurately identify fraudulent credit card transactions in a highly imbalanced dataset, where fraudulent transactions are rare compared to legitimate ones.
2. Dataset and Features
Use an appropriate credit card transactions dataset, such as the Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset, which contains features like:
Time: Time elapsed between transactions.
Amount: Transaction amount.
Anonymized PCA-transformed features: Features extracted to anonymize the data.
Class: Target variable indicating fraud (1) or non-fraud (0).
Load the dataset and check for any missing or null values. Drop or impute these values if necessary.
3. Data Preprocessing
Standardize/Normalize Features: Normalize or standardize features like Amount to help the model converge faster.
Handle Class Imbalance:
Use SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to generate synthetic samples for the minority class.
Alternatively, use undersampling for the majority class or class weights in algorithms like logistic regression or tree-based models.
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyze class distributions and check for correlations between features.
Visualize fraud and non-fraud distributions across features, which can help identify patterns or anomalies.
5. Modeling Approaches
Approach 1: Supervised Learning
Split the Dataset: Split into training and testing sets, ensuring the fraud distribution remains representative in both.

Select a Model: Algorithms that handle imbalanced data well include:

Logistic Regression with class_weight='balanced'.
Random Forests or XGBoost with class weights or custom sampling.
Support Vector Machines (SVM), which can be tuned for imbalanced classes.
Implement Resampling Techniques: Apply SMOTE or undersampling if needed to balance the dataset.

Train and Evaluate the Model:

Use metrics like Precision, Recall, and F1-Score for the minority class (fraud) as accuracy can be misleading.
Confusion Matrix: To visualize model performance.
AUC-ROC Curve: To assess the separability of fraud and non-fraud classes
